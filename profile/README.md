- Alpha Lipoic Acid: A powerful antioxidant that helps improve insulin sensitivity and supports overall metabolic function.
- Chromium: A trace mineral that enhances insulin action and helps maintain normal blood sugar levels.

By combining these ingredients, GlycoVantage works to improve how your body processes glucose, helping to keep your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. Over time, consistent use of the supplement may lead to improved overall metabolic health.
